        Hello, I am currently applying for the job of <span class="about__emphasis" style="font-size: 1.2em;">Front-End
          Developer </span>especially a Part-Time Job since I am

        Studying in the Philippines as a <span class="about__emphasis" style="font-size: 1.7em;">College Freshman</span>
        in the course of <span class="about__emphasis" style="font-size: .9em;">Computer Science</span> and I want to
        work and earn
        while enhancing more of my skills in college. If I will be presented with a Full-Time Job, I can consider to
        grab
        that opportunity and focus on the job that I loved. Thankfully I will be free to work in this coming school
        break
        from April to August.</p>

        I do lift weights and had a good deal of knowledge in the fitness industry. <span
          class="about__emphasis">WORKING OUT</span> is Hard and Full of Pain
        but it is the only way to improve always remember that “Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about

        I will also like to share that I enjoy
        <span class="about__emphasis" style="font-size: 2.5em;">playing CHESS</span>, I like how the way
        game plays on, the strategy, the creativity, the plans, the risk and sacrifices, the pressure, the uncertainity,
        all of these makes the game exciting. There is a quote in chess that "Every chess master was once a beginner"
        this
        quote serves an important meaning and can be also applied to other areas of life and I am grateful of the
        benefits
        of this game to my life.
        <br>
        <span class="about__emphasis" style="font-size: 1.3em;"> Playing Guitar</span> is also my hobby as I am a Music
        Lover and I will enjoy it forever and
        sorry to

          important things that I will do in a site, or what the clients wants him to do with his site. In addtion, I
          ask myself some serveral questions: What attack will do in this type of site? What are the designs elements I
          will use(fonts, color combinations, etc.)? Who are the audience? How can the site serves its purpose?</p>

        <h1>Implementing Phase</h1>

        <p class="column__text">After Planning, I must find a way how to implement my plans for the site. I will
          structure and organize my Development Workspace especially my files for faster and cleaner coding, Design the
          site based on the plan with some help of prototyping tools, and this time, I will know what to add more in the
          site and add it to the plan and I will able to know the estimated time of completion of the website.</p>

        <h1>Coding Period</h1>

        <p class="column__text">And now that all has been planned and implemented, the coding phase comes into place.
          First, In the coding phase, I will start to code the desktop version of the website design and only after that
          I will now start to make the site responsive in diffrent devices. When I have any problem, I use some
          resources to get some help like Google, Youtube, Stack Overflow and so on, and learned from it.

          I am using Visual Studio Code in coding, because its very convenient as it is a very powerful text editor that
          I get easily comfortable with and I also use Github to save my projects to repositories and have a track on my
          code and when I moved a place I can easily continue my work and I conclude that Git and Github is a Safe Haven
          for the developers. In addition, some music will do, to improve my productivity and to increase my performance
          in the development. When problem comes visualizing comes into play, I write the problem and distinguished it
          into smallest details as much as possible to know the characteristics of the problem to solve it effectively.
